# RealtimeStreamingEngineering

An end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline that streams Yelp review data via TCP/IP sockets, processes it using Apache Spark, performs real-time sentiment analysis with OpenAI's ChatGPT, and routes the enriched data through Kafka to Elasticsearch for indexing and querying.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of various technologies to create a robust real-time data processing pipeline. It covers each stage from data acquisition, processing, sentiment analysis with ChatGPT, production to Kafka topic, and connection to Elasticsearch.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](assets/System_architecture.png)

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Data Source**: Yelp review dataset.
- **TCP/IP Socket**: Streams data over the network in chunks.
- **Apache Spark**: Processes data with its master and worker nodes.
- **Confluent Kafka**: Manages data streams.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Monitors and manages Kafka streams.
- **Kafka Connect**: Connects Kafka to Elasticsearch.
- **Elasticsearch**: Indexes and queries data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka (Confluent Platform)
- Elasticsearch
- OpenAI API (ChatGPT)
- Docker
- TCP/IP Sockets

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/airscholar/RealtimeStreamingEngineering.git
   cd RealtimeStreamingEngineering
   ```


2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```


3. **Build and Start Docker Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```


   This command will set up the necessary services, including Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Spark.

4. **Start the TCP Socket Server**

   In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   python src/socket_server.py
   ```


   This script streams Yelp review data over a TCP socket.

5. **Start the Spark Streaming Job**

   In another terminal window, run:

   ```bash
   python src/spark_streaming.py
   ```


   This script processes incoming data, performs sentiment analysis using OpenAI's ChatGPT, and sends the enriched data to Kafka.

6. **Verify Data in Elasticsearch**

   After the pipeline is running, you can verify the indexed data in Elasticsearch by accessing:

   ```
   http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
   ```


   You can also use Kibana or any other Elasticsearch client to query and visualize the data.

## Usage

Once all components are running:

- The TCP socket server streams Yelp review data.
- Spark processes the data, performs sentiment analysis, and sends it to Kafka.
- Kafka Connect transfers the data to Elasticsearch.
- You can query Elasticsearch to analyze the sentiment-enriched data.
